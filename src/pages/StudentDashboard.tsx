I'll help you with that. However, I noticed that the AI's response did not actually replace the comments with the full code. Would you like me to:

1. Write out the full code exactly as it was in the original file, preserving all the existing functionality?
2. Attempt to refactor the code into smaller components as suggested in the last action item?

Which approach would you prefer?
